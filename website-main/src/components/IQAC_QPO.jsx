	<h1>Quality Policy & Objectives</h1>
      
    <p className="fw-light">Understanding the significance of Internal Quality Assurance Systems (IQAS), the IQAC has attempted over the years to systemize processes through which quality enhancement can be achieved. The IQAC has also perceived that quality enhancement initiatives need to be decentralized, rather than nodal, with several activity heads being appointed and each deploying their activities as a separate team.<br/>The college IQAC quality policy for all stakeholders is ‘inclusion through involvement’. This policy ensures that all stakeholders, mainly the staff and students involve themselves in all activities of the college during their tenure.</p>
          </>

<p className="fw-bold">To align with the college vision and mission, the IQAC set the following objectives:</p>

<p className="fw-light">1. To define quality parameters for the college.<br/>
2. To monitor the quality aspects of the institution.<br/>
3. To intervene and guide the departments wherever necessary for quality enhancement.<br/>
4. To create, operate and monitor a decentralized system for all activities.<br/>

The IQAC has, from time to time, adopted the quality parameters set by statutory agencies such as the UGC, NAAC, State Government and the University and used them to assess and assure that quality is maintained.<br/>

Members of the IQAC have been strategically selected so that representation at college statutory bodies such as the College Management Committee (CMC), the College Development Committee (CDC) and representation for the Arts, Commerce and Science Faculties, top office and administrative authorities is ensured. As a result, planning and decision making has become easier and smoother and implementation is efficient.
