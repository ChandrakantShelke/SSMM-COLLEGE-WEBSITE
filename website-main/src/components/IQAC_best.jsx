        <b><p className="text-start">Best Practice – II </p></b><br/>
	     <b> <p className="text-center">Financial help to the needy rural students:</p></b><br/>

    <p className="fw-light"><b>Objectives of the practice :  :</b>  Most of the students are from rural area and some of them do face financial problems severely, such students are to be worked out at the time of admission or during the academic teaching – learning process. Such students are listed and financial help is provided to them. Students adoption scheme is also in practice. The college also offers merit scholarship to the students (other than GOI)<br/>
<b>Context :</b>At the time of the admission, the teachers in the admission committee find out such students, they are personally called up on and on teacher discuss the financial issues of about 10 students and finally the severely needy are listed.
<br/>
<b>The practice :</b>At the entry level such financially weak students are short listed and a meeting is called they are asked to apply for financial help. The applications are sorted out and a final list is prepared by the committee (SAF) and they are provided financial help or college merit scholarship <br/>

<b>Evidence of success :</b> Students belonging to rural background definitely suffer from financial problems but they are either shy or they don’t want to expose themselves. But after the financial help they continue their education and after getting the basic degree they feel really indebted to the institute and the concerned teachers..<br/>

<b>Problems encountered and resources required :</b> Basically the rural students are very shy and they don’t want to open themselves as financially weak and so extra efforts are to be taken to find out such students and to persuade them to apply for SAF or college merit scholarship. If the list is heavy then only financial problems are posed for the instituted.</p><br/>
